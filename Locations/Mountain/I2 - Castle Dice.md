# Description

![[Castle Dice.png]]

Read to the players when they first approach
> The frozen wasteland stretches endlessly around you, a dead plain of snow and ice where the wind cuts like blades and silence presses heavy on the soul. Then, through the haze of falling snow, it rises—_Castle Dice_, hewn into the blackened face of a volcanic mountain. Lava boils from its summit, glowing like open wounds in the earth, and molten streams cut burning paths through the permafrost, casting flickering red light across the icy ground.

> The castle itself is a grotesque marvel: a colossal stone skull forms its entrance, lava pouring from its eyes in fiery tears. Jagged towers lean out from the volcanic rock, wreathed in steam where heat clashes violently with cold. It is a place of impossible contradiction—ice and fire, silence and fury

Castle Dice is home to [[Lady Dice]]. It is her Lair and will allow her to take lair actions while she is present.

A frozen mirror room where Lady Dice confronts the remnants of her past life and converses with the shades of who she once was.

## Guest Chambers

## Crypt of Endless Service
Thousands of undead soldiers rest here in deathless stasis, ready to awaken at her command.

## Flesh Pit
Bio-magical labs where monstrous undead hybrids are grown—stitched from bones, lava beasts, and fallen enemies.

## Secret Entrance
A massive stone door carved into the volcanic rock.

Across its face is a relief of Lady Dice holding a handful of dice (d4, 2d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) and a snake coiled around her chair

Beneath it, an inscription reads:

"Fate is a gamble, odds ever shifting. Tell me, mortals: which number never loses?"

You can see a slot in the snakes mouth as its eyes glean towards you.
