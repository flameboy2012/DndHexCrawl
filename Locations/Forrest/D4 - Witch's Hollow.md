## Description
Tucked away in a mossy glade surrounded by twisted hazel and rowan trees, the **Witch’s Hollow** feels like a secret the forest is reluctant to share. A cobblestone path, half-swallowed by creeping ivy and fungi that glow faintly blue at twilight, leads to a squat, bulbous cottage built from knotted roots and clay daub. The roof curves like the shell of a snail, covered in thick moss and dotted with crimson-capped mushrooms.

Bundles of drying herbs hang from the eaves, their pungent scent mingling with the sweet aroma of honey and something vaguely medicinal. A crooked chimney leans drunkenly to one side, puffing out slow curls of lilac smoke. Wind chimes made from old bones and silver teaspoons tinkle in the breeze, creating a tune that somehow keeps time with the rustling leaves.

There’s a small wooden sign nailed to the door that reads in swirling green ink:  
**"Herbs, Healings, and Help – Knock Twice, Mind the Cat."**
### Rhyme Sung as the Party Arrives

As the party approaches, they hear her voice—crackling like old bark, but strangely melodic—as she stirs a bubbling cauldron inside:

> _"A pinch of thorn, a drop of dew,_  
> _A whispered name and morning rue._  
> _Bubble, bubble, twist and blend,_  
> _A flask of life for wounds to mend!"_

She turns to greet them with a smile as wide as a toadstool cap, her hands still stained with berry juice and powdered root.
