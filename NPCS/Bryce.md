## 🎭 Description & Personality

_A quick physical description, voice notes, and dominant personality traits._

- **Appearance:** Wiry and sun-leathered, Bryce wears a long oilskin duster over patched robes, gumboots caked with mud, and a wide-brimmed hat decorated with charms (bones, feathers, quartz). His beard is streaked with grey and eucalyptus leaves often cling to his cloak.
    
- **Voice/Accent:** Thick Aussie accent; slow, deliberate speech like he’s halfway between storytelling and brewing tea.
    
- **Mannerisms:** Smokes a carved pipe of twisted wood, mutters to trees, always has a kettle nearby. Taps his staff twice before casting spells.
    
- **Personality Traits:** Wise, grounded, cheeky, prone to tangents, deeply attuned to nature’s moods.
    
- **Quirks:** Gives nicknames to _everything_, even rocks. Talks to his familiar like it’s the local mayor. Occasionally refers to thunder as “the Sky Mob havin’ a barney.”

## 🎯 Motivations & Goals

_What drives them? What are they working toward?_

- **Short-Term:** Keep Marco out of jail (again), find a rare bark sample, and study ley-line drift in this region.
    
- **Long-Term:** Map the Dreaming Currents—the magical rivers beneath the land—and pass on his bushcraft wizardry to someone worthy.
    
- **Fears/Weaknesses:** Deep-seated fear of urban magic corruption and “tower wizards.” Haunted by a past mistake that caused a forest fire.

## 🧠 Knowledge & Secrets

_What do they know that matters? What are they hiding?_

- Knows: Where the ley-lines run “crooked,” how to track a bunyip, and which flowers cure snakebite _and_ heartbreak.
    
- Hides: A page from an ancient bush grimoire he swore to burn but couldn't.
    
- Believes: Magic belongs to the land, and anyone who cages it (wands, towers, guilds) is dancing too close to fire.
