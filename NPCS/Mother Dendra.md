## 🎭 Description & Personality

_A quick physical description, voice notes, and dominant personality traits._

- **Appearance:** A bent old woman with bark-tough skin and moss-coloured robes that seem to grow from her body. Her long white hair is braided with roots and feathers. Her hut looks like a part of the forest: crooked, mushroom-covered, and half-grown into a gnarled old willow.
    
- **Voice/Accent:** Low, rasping, sing-songy with an odd rhythm—like wind through leaves. Often speaks in rhyme or metaphor.
    
- **Mannerisms:** Tends her mushrooms and herbs as she talks; strokes her cat absently; offers tea or strange root candies to guests.
    
- **Personality Traits:** Calm, eerie, nurturing, playful yet sharp. Fiercely protective of the natural balance.
    
- **Quirks:** Hears the whispers of fungi and speaks to them out loud; brews tea from things that _shouldn’t_ taste good—but somehow do.

## 🎯 Motivations & Goals

_What drives them? What are they working toward?_

- **Short-Term:** Sell healing potions and gather rare mushrooms before the rains.
    
- **Long-Term:** Maintain the balance of life, death, and regrowth in her Hollow; protect the ley-marrow beneath the forest.
    
- **Fears/Weaknesses:** The rise of fire magic and deforestation. Hides deep grief for something long past—perhaps a lost child, or a corrupted grove.

## 🧠 Knowledge & Secrets

_What do they know that matters? What are they hiding?_

- Knows: The names of nearly every herb, root, spore, and tree in the region. Can identify a potion’s ingredients by scent.
    
- Hides: A pact made long ago with a forgotten nature god—still binding, still potent.
    
- Believes: That decay is sacred. Everything must die to be reborn.

| Bryce          | Occasional Ally  | They trade secrets and herbs, and argue about “leaf-lore vs root-lore.” Respectful but sparring.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Marco          | Bemused Guardian | She sees his chaos as natural, if loud—often gives him salves for his “axe rash.”                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Thimblehex** | Familiar         | An unnaturally intelligent black cat with luminous green eyes and a crescent-shaped white patch on her chest. Moves silently, often disappears into shadow, and is rumored to be part fey—or something older. Sleeps in skulls, judges everyone. |

## 🪧 Story Hooks & Uses

- Can brew _powerful healing potions_ (50 gp each), but may offer rare concoctions in exchange for strange items (e.g., a feather from a dream, or the name of a ghost).
    
- Warns the party about a _“barkborn” curse_ stirring deep in the forest.
    
- May need help regrowing a _sacred mushroom ring_ damaged by intruders.
    
- Could offer spore-based resurrection... but it _changes_ those it brings back.

## 📝 GM Notes (Secret or Flexible Info)

_For your eyes only—twists, hidden loyalties, dynamic plans._

- **Changes over time:** Her powers are tied to a waning god of rot and regrowth. If that god fades, so does she.
    
- **Optional twist:** She was once a powerful archdruid who _chose to forget_ her past and grow into a simpler form. Her memories can return… at a cost.
    
- **Wildcard Trait:** Thimblehex is her warden as much as her companion—an ancient spirit bound into feline form, silently ensuring Dendra doesn’t repeat old sins.
