## 🎭 Description & Personality

_A quick physical description, voice notes, and dominant personality traits._

- **Appearance:** Towering and broad-shouldered with a tangled mane of black curls and a wild beard; wears sleeveless fur-trimmed leathers that show off his battle scars and intricate tattoos of beasts and flames. His armor is half decorative, half practical—patched with hide and dented metal.
    
- **Voice/Accent:** Deep, booming, and gravelly with a slight country twang; laughs like a landslide.
    
- **Mannerisms:** Talks to his axe like it’s a best friend, cracks his knuckles before every fight, punches walls when thinking.
    
- **Personality Traits:** Loyal, brash, high-spirited, protective, thrives in chaos.
    
- **Quirks:** Sleeps with one eye open, insists Greg (his axe) has opinions, eats entire wheels of cheese in one sitting.

## 🎯 Motivations & Goals

_What drives them? What are they working toward?_

- **Short-Term:** Protect Bryce and find “more things worth fighting.”
- **Long-Term:** Carve out a legendary story that will echo in barbarian sagas (even if half of it is made up).
- **Fears/Weaknesses:** Deep fear of magical mind control; doesn’t trust magic-users he doesn’t know (“except Bryce, he’s alright”).

## 🧠 Knowledge & Secrets

_What do they know that matters? What are they hiding?_

- Knows: The “Stonejaw Roar,” a secret rage technique passed down from his clan.
- Hides: That his axe _Greg_ may actually be cursed… or possessed… or just plain haunted.
- Believes: That strength comes from loyalty, not bloodline—that family is chosen in battle.

## 📝 GM Notes (Secret or Flexible Info)

_For your eyes only—twists, hidden loyalties, dynamic plans._

- **Changes over time:** Might begin hearing Greg’s voice more clearly… possibly due to a growing bond, or a creeping possession.
    
- **Optional twist:** Marco’s barbarian rage is tied to ancient, primal magic he doesn’t understand—his bloodline might not be entirely mundane.
