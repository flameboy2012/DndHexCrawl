# Travel

### Base Travel Speed

- Walking Speed: A typical adventuring party traveling on foot covers 24 miles/day on flat, unobstructed terrain, assuming 8 hours of travel per day.
- This equals 4 hexes/day under ideal conditions.
### Terrain Modifiers

| **Terrain Type**         | **Foot Travel Modifier** | **Mounted Travel Modifier** | **Notes**                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Road or Flat Plains      | No change (x1)           | No change (x1)              | Fastest travel.                                        |
| Hills                    | x0.75 (3 hexes/day)      | x0.75 (4 hexes/day)         | Slower progress due to uneven ground.                  |
| Dense Forest or Jungle   | x0.5 (2 hexes/day)       | x0.5 (3 hexes/day)          | Difficult to navigate and traverse.                    |
| Swamp or Marsh           | x0.5 (2 hexes/day)       | x0.5 (3 hexes/day)          | Risk of getting stuck or slowed down by water and mud. |
| Mountains (with paths)   | x0.5 (2 hexes/day)       | x0.5 (3 hexes/day)          | Even with paths, slopes slow progress significantly.   |
| Mountains (no paths)     | x0.25 (1 hex/day)        | N/A                         | Requires climbing and is extremely slow.               |
| Desert (Hard Sand)       | No change (x1)           | No change (x1)              | Normal pace if well-prepared.                          |
| Desert (Soft Sand/Dunes) | x0.5 (2 hexes/day)       | x0.5 (3 hexes/day)          | Deep sand makes walking and riding much slower.        |
| Snowy Terrain            | x0.5 (2 hexes/day)       | x0.5 (3 hexes/day)          | Includes tundra and light snow.                        |
| Deep Snow/Blizzard       | x0.25 (1 hex/day)        | x0.25 (1 hex/day)           | Requires intense effort to move.                       |

### Travel Modifiers

1. Encumbrance:
	- Heavily encumbered characters reduce travel speed by 25%.
	- Apply this reduction to the base hex/day calculation.
2. Forced March:
	- The party can push themselves to travel up to 50% farther in a single day.
	- After the first 8 hours, each additional hour of travel requires a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + number of extra hours) to avoid exhaustion.
3. Rest Stops:
	- If the party takes breaks for extended rests, reduce their effective travel speed.
4. Navigation and Scouting:
	- If the party spends time scouting or navigating, reduce travel speed by 1–2 hexes/day.

### Mounts and Vehicles

1. Mounts:
	- Riding Horse: 36 miles/day (6 hexes) on flat terrain.
	- Warhorse: 36 miles/day (6 hexes) on flat terrain but slows in dense terrain (like forest or swamp).
	- Mules: 24 miles/day (4 hexes), but better suited for difficult terrain.
	- Exotic Mounts (like Griffons or Giant Eagles): Use flying speeds to bypass terrain entirely, but factor in exhaustion and the need for rest.
2. Vehicles:
	- Cart/Wagon: Travels at the same speed as the draft animal pulling it (typically 4 hexes/day).
	- Sailing Ships: Depends on wind and water conditions, typically covering 6–12 hexes/day.
